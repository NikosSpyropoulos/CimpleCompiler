# CimpleCompiler
In this project I created the compiler of the language Cimple using python. Cimple is a small, educational, programming language. It resembles the C language, from which it draws ideas and structures, but is much smaller, both in the supported structures and, of course, in programming capabilities.

You can find more information about the Cimple language in the file Cimple.pdf (greek language)
